tophonetic.py
=============

To Phonetic is a python script that takes arguments and turns it into NATO phonetic alphabet.

This is just a handy script, especially for techs doing phone support, that one could use in conjunction with output you need to read out to someone, such as a password generation script.

The standard NATO alphabet excludes symbols, so for those it offers a few common choices where applicable.
